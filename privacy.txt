Last Updated: December 5, 2025
1. Overview
Welcome to Proper ID. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.
2. Photo and Face Data (100% Offline)
We do NOT collect, store, or upload your photos or face data.
Local Processing: All image processing, including background removal, face detection, and cropping, is performed entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework and CoreImage technology.
No Cloud Uploads: Your photos never leave your iPhone. We do not have access to your original photos or the ID photos you create.
3. Data Collection by Third Parties (Advertising)
To keep the app free, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide personalized advertising and analytics.
Data collected by AdMob may include:
Identifiers: Device ID (such as IDFA) to track ad performance.
Usage Data: How you interact with the ads (e.g., clicks, impressions).
Diagnostics: Crash logs and performance data related to the ads.
Location: Coarse location data (not precise location) to show relevant local ads.
You can manage your tracking preferences via the iOS system settings ("Allow Apps to Request to Track") or through the privacy prompt displayed when you first launch the app.
